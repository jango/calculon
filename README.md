# PC
This project is a generalized implementation of a consumer-producer problem
using Python's multiprocessing module. It allows you:
* define your own custom producer and consumer function;
* specify the number of producers and consumers;
* kick off the setup, sit back and enjoy your coffee;

This was written because I am often in need of a simple setup that would allow
me to process the parallel computing problems that will not benefit from a
heavier approach.

# Install
