# Calculon
This project is a customizable implementation of the producer-consumer pattern
using Python's multiprocessing module:

* define a custom producer and a custom consumer function;
* specify the number of producers and consumers;
* kick off the processes, sit back and enjoy your coffee;

I wrote this because I needed a simple setup that would allow me to process
simple parallel computing tasks that will not benefit from a heavier approach.
