# PC
This project is a customizable implementation of the producer-consumer pattern
using Python's multiprocessing module:

* define a custom producer and a custom consumer function;
* specify the number of producers and consumers;
* kick off the processes, sit back and enjoy your coffee;

This was written because I am often in need of a simple setup that would allow
me to process the parallel computing problems that will not benefit from a
heavier approach.
