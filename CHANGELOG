# CHANGELOG for calculon

## 1.1.0 - 06/April/2013

   * Fixing packaging to include calculon.test

## 1.1.0 - 04/April/2013

    The package has been rewritten completely to improve the stability
    and offer more options, it is not back-compatible. Features added / changed:

    * consumer and producer functions are more isolated now;
    * you have a choice between thread / processes and you can have a mix (i.e. run producers in threads and consumers as processes);
    * results from each consumer / producer are returned as a dictionary all together once Calculon finishes.
